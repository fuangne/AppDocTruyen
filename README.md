This is the basic story reading app I did in the mobile app subject. Although not too good, I am proud of my product. 

This application is written in Java language on Android Studio and uses SQLite.

The interface is basic, quite eye-catching and has basic functions such as: adding, deleting, editing, listing favorite stories, commenting, dropping likes or dislikes, ranking stories,... and managing for admin.
